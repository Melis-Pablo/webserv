## What is HTTP and its role in web communication?

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application-layer protocol designed for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It follows a client-server model where:

- **Client-Server Protocol**: Clients make requests to servers, which process and return appropriate responses
- **Stateless**: Each request is independent and the server doesn't retain session information between requests
- **Connection-Based**: Built on top of TCP/IP, ensuring reliable data transmission
- **Text-Based**: Messages are text-based and human-readable
- **Extensible**: Can be extended with additional functionality through HTTP headers
- **Port**: Typically uses port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS

Key Characteristics:
- Connectionless: After response, connection between client and server is lost
- Media Independent: Any type of data can be sent as long as both client and server know how to handle it
- Platform/Language Independent: Can be used with any client or server technology

## HTTP Request Structure

### Methods (GET, POST, DELETE)

#### GET
- Purpose: Retrieve data from the server
- Characteristics:
  - Data sent in URL parameters
  - Idempotent (multiple identical requests should have same effect as single request)
  - Cacheable
  - Should not modify server state
  - URL length limited by browser/server
- Example:
  ```
  GET /api/users?id=123 HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  ```

#### POST
- Purpose: Submit data to be processed to the server
- Characteristics:
  - Data sent in request body
  - Not idempotent
  - Not cacheable by default
  - Can modify server state
  - No size limitations on data
- Example:
  ```
  POST /api/users HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  Content-Type: application/json
  
  {"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}
  ```

#### DELETE
- Purpose: Remove a resource from the server
- Characteristics:
  - Idempotent
  - Not cacheable
  - Modifies server state
  - Usually requires authentication
- Example:
  ```
  DELETE /api/users/123 HTTP/1.1
  Host: example.com
  Authorization: Bearer token123
  ```

### Request Headers

#### Start Line (Request Line)
Format: `METHOD URI HTTP-VERSION`
Examples:
- `GET /index.html HTTP/1.1`
- `POST /api/data HTTP/1.1`
- `DELETE /users/123 HTTP/1.1`

#### Common Request Headers
- `Host`: Domain name of the server (required in HTTP/1.1)
- `User-Agent`: Client software identification
- `Accept`: Media types the client can process
- `Accept-Language`: Preferred languages
- `Accept-Encoding`: Supported encodings (e.g., gzip)
- `Authorization`: Authentication credentials
- `Content-Type`: Format of the request body
- `Content-Length`: Size of the request body in bytes
- `Cookie`: Stored HTTP cookies
- `Connection`: Control options for current connection

#### Request Body
- Optional component (common in POST/PUT requests)
- Contains data being sent to the server
- Format specified by Content-Type header
- Common formats:
  - Form data
  - JSON
  - XML
  - Binary data (files)

## HTTP Response Structure

### Status Codes

#### 1xx (Informational)
- 100 Continue
- 101 Switching Protocols
- 102 Processing

#### 2xx (Success)
- 200 OK
- 201 Created
- 204 No Content
- 206 Partial Content

#### 3xx (Redirection)
- 301 Moved Permanently
- 302 Found
- 304 Not Modified
- 307 Temporary Redirect
- 308 Permanent Redirect

#### 4xx (Client Error)
- 400 Bad Request
- 401 Unauthorized
- 403 Forbidden
- 404 Not Found
- 405 Method Not Allowed
- 413 Payload Too Large
- 429 Too Many Requests

#### 5xx (Server Error)
- 500 Internal Server Error
- 501 Not Implemented
- 502 Bad Gateway
- 503 Service Unavailable
- 504 Gateway Timeout

### Response Headers

#### Status Line
Format: `HTTP-VERSION STATUS-CODE REASON-PHRASE`
Example: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`

#### Common Response Headers
- `Content-Type`: Format of response body
- `Content-Length`: Size of response body
- `Content-Encoding`: Encoding used on the data
- `Server`: Software used by the server
- `Location`: URL for redirection
- `Set-Cookie`: Cookie to be stored by the client
- `Cache-Control`: Directives for caching mechanisms
- `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: CORS settings
- `Last-Modified`: Last modification date of resource
- `ETag`: Version identifier for the resource

#### Response Body
- Contains requested resource or error message
- Format defined by Content-Type header
- Common formats:
  - HTML
  - JSON
  - XML
  - Binary data (images, files)
  - Text

## HTTP/1.1 Specific Features

Key improvements over HTTP/1.0:
1. **Persistent Connections**
   - Keep-alive by default
   - Multiple requests over single TCP connection
   - Reduced latency and network congestion

2. **Pipelining**
   - Send multiple requests without waiting for responses
   - Responses must be in same order as requests
   - Not widely used due to implementation challenges

3. **Chunked Transfer Encoding**
   - Send response in chunks
   - Useful for dynamic content
   - No need to know content length in advance

4. **Host Header**
   - Required in HTTP/1.1
   - Enables virtual hosting
   - Multiple domains on single IP address

5. **Cache Control**
   - More sophisticated caching mechanisms
   - Better control over caching behavior
   - New cache-control directives

6. **Content Negotiation**
   - Client can specify preferred formats
   - Language preferences
   - Character set preferences
   - Compression preferences

## Practice Tools

### curl
Basic usage:
```bash
# GET request
curl http://example.com

# POST request
curl -X POST -d "data=value" http://example.com

# Include headers
curl -i http://example.com

# Follow redirects
curl -L http://example.com

# Set headers
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://example.com
```

### telnet
Basic usage:
```bash
# Connect to server
telnet example.com 80

# Send GET request
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
[press Enter twice]

# Send POST request
POST /path HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 11

data=value
[press Enter]
```
